# Simple-Wifi-Util
This utility makes WiFi management more easy and convenient.

This module require premissions (CHAGE_WIFI_STATE, ACCESS_WIFI_STATE).

Important!
you should make target adk below 23, because it will be needed requiring the permmissions run-time and it will be result of empty wifi list.
